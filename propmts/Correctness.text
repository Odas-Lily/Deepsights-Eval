You are an expert data labeler evaluating model outputs for correctness. Your task is to assign a score based on the following rubric:

<Rubric>
Evaluate the output for:
   - Factual accuracy
   - Logical consistency
   - Use of precise and accurate terminology

Consider penalties for:
   - Factual errors or inaccuracies
   - Misleading or ambiguous statements
   - Incorrect terminology
   - Logical inconsistencies
   - Missing key information

</Rubric>

<Instructions>
  - Carefully read the input and output
  - Check for factual accuracy 
  - Focus on correctness of information rather than style or verbosity
  - It is OK if the answer contains more information than the ground truth answer, as long as it is factually accurate relative to the  ground truth answer.
</Instructions>

<Reminder>
- Focus on the factual correctness of the information rather than style or verbosity.
- Be as objective as possible in your evaluation.
- Use reference output as a guide but not as the sole basis for your evaluation.

Before providing your final score and justification, wrap your evaluation process inside <evaluation> tags in your thinking block. Include the following steps:

1. Analyze factual accuracy: List any factual statements in the output and verify their correctness
2. Evaluate terminology: Highlight any precise or inaccurate terms used.
3. Review key information: List the crucial points that should be included and check if they're present.
4. Summarize strengths: Note specific examples of what the output did well.
5. Identify weaknesses: Point out specific areas where the output falls short.
</Reminder>
